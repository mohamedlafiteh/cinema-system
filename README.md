I did divide the task into smaller tasks and started working on them

The first task I worked on display the ticket price when select in the state

Then I worked on the adding option for the real3D and Imax
And add the calculation then display results in the total.

I am working on the Add ticket and the Thursday offer and the ticket totaling which will finish it by tomorrow and will push the changes to the gihub

I am also going to add some unit testing for the code, and some css.

I will add router and refactor the code into different components
